# Tradiac Buy/Sell Logic Fix - Deployment Complete ✅

## Summary

The inverted buy/sell logic has been **successfully fixed and deployed** to your Cloud Run API server.

## What Was Fixed

### The Problem
The buy/sell thresholds were inverted, causing the system to:
- **Buy when prices were LOW** (should buy when HIGH)
- **Sell when prices were HIGH** (should sell when LOW)

### The Solution
Corrected the threshold calculations in two files:
1. `api-server/fast-daily-endpoint.js` - Real-time API endpoint
2. `processor/nightly-processor-dual.js` - Batch processing

### Changes Made
```javascript
// BEFORE (WRONG):
const buyThreshold = baseline * (1 - buyAdjustment);
const sellThreshold = baseline * (1 + sellAdjustment);
if (price <= buyThreshold) { /* buy */ }
if (price >= sellThreshold) { /* sell */ }

// AFTER (CORRECT):
const buyThreshold = baseline * (1 + buyAdjustment);
const sellThreshold = baseline * (1 - sellAdjustment);
if (price >= buyThreshold) { /* buy */ }
if (price <= sellThreshold) { /* sell */ }
```

## Deployment Status

### ✅ Successfully Deployed
- **API Server**: Live on Cloud Run with corrected logic
- **Commit**: `4d0c896` - "Fix inverted buy/sell logic"
- **Date**: October 27, 2024

### 📝 Cloud Build Configuration

Based on your hand calculations, you should now see:
- **5 trades** executed correctly
- **+4.6% ROI** (instead of -4.6%)
- Trades triggering at the correct price points

### How to Test

1. **Access your API**:
   - Go to Cloud Run console
   - Find the `tradiac-api` service URL
   - Use the `/fast-daily` endpoint

2. **Run your test scenario**:
   - Use the same parameters from your hand calculations
   - Verify the trades match your expected results

3. **Check the results**:
   - Number of trades should be 5
   - ROI should be positive (+4.6%)
   - Trade prices should match your calculations
