# Pattern Analysis System - Ready for Setup

## What We've Built

I've created a complete Pattern Analysis System that will help you identify which trading strategies work best during specific BTC market patterns. This is **Track A** from our plan - getting insights fast by analyzing historical patterns.

## The 6 Patterns We'll Analyze

1. **CRASH** - BTC drops 3%+ in 72 hours (market panics)
2. **SURGE** - BTC rises 5%+ in 24 hours (FOMO rallies)
3. **MONDAY_GAP** - Weekend moves create 1%+ Monday gaps
4. **HIGH_VOL** - 30-day volatility above 4% (uncertain markets)
5. **LOW_VOL** - 30-day volatility below 2% (calm markets)
6. **RECORD_HIGH_DROP** ‚≠ê - BTC hits record high, then drops 2%+ within 5 days
   - **This is your special pattern** - measures overreaction behavior
   - People get excited at all-time highs, then freak out when it drops
   - Your algorithm measures the magnitude of that freakout

## Files Created

### Database Scripts (4 files)
1. **`database/create_pattern_analysis_tables.sql`**
   - Creates 4 new tables: btc_aggregated, btc_patterns, pattern_performance, daily_btc_context
   - Creates views for quick pattern summaries

2. **`database/populate_btc_aggregated.sql`**
   - Aggregates minute BTC data into 10-minute bars
   - Reduces data volume by 90% (144 bars/day vs 1,440)
   - Calculates OHLC and volume for each 10-min period

3. **`database/populate_daily_btc_context.sql`**
   - Calculates daily metrics: volatility, moving averages, gaps
   - Tracks record highs and days since record high
   - Identifies Monday gaps and volume patterns

4. **`database/detect_patterns.sql`**
   - Detects all 6 pattern types from the data
   - Stores pattern instances with characteristics
   - Calculates pattern-specific metrics (overreaction scores, etc.)

### Documentation (3 files)
1. **`database/PATTERN_ANALYSIS_SETUP.md`**
   - Detailed setup guide with troubleshooting
   - Expected results and verification queries
   - Performance notes and data freshness info

2. **`database/RUN_PATTERN_SETUP.md`**
   - Quick copy/paste guide for running scripts
   - Step-by-step with expected outputs
   - Verification queries

3. **`PATTERN_ANALYSIS_SYSTEM.md`**
   - Complete system overview and architecture
   - Detailed explanation of each pattern type
   - Workflow from pattern to insight
   - Dashboard reports to build
   - API endpoints needed

4. **`PATTERN_ANALYSIS_READY.md`** (this file)
   - Summary of what's ready
   - Next steps

## What Happens Next

### Step 1: You Run SQL Scripts (3-5 minutes)
Open Cloud SQL Console and run these 4 scripts in order:
1. `create_pattern_analysis_tables.sql` (5 seconds)
2. `populate_btc_aggregated.sql` (30-60 seconds)
3. `populate_daily_btc_context.sql` (60-90 seconds)
4. `detect_patterns.sql` (30-60 seconds)

**See:** `database/RUN_PATTERN_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions

### Step 2: Report Results
After running the scripts, tell me:
- How many patterns were detected for each type?
- Any errors or issues?
- What does the pattern summary show?

### Step 3: I Build API Endpoints (2-3 hours)
I'll create 5 API endpoints:
- `/api/patterns/summary` - Overview of all patterns
- `/api/patterns/instances` - Get specific pattern instances
- `/api/patterns/performance` - Strategy performance during patterns
- `/api/patterns/best-strategies` - Top strategies per pattern
- `/api/patterns/overreactions` - Record high drops ranked by overreaction score

### Step 4: I Build Dashboard Reports (3-4 hours)
Three new reports:
- **Pattern Overview** - See all 6 pattern types, click to drill down
- **Pattern Deep Dive** - Analyze specific pattern instances
- **Overreaction Analysis** - Focus on your special pattern (record high drops)

### Step 5: We Analyze Results Together
- Which patterns occur most frequently?
- Which strategies consistently win during each pattern?
- How big are the overreactions after record highs?
- Which stocks overreact the most?

## Expected Results

After setup, you should see approximately:
- **350-500 total pattern instances** across Jan 2024 - Oct 2025
- **HIGH_VOL**: 150-200 days (most common)
- **MONDAY_GAP**: 80-100 instances
- **SURGE**: 30-50 instances
- **CRASH**: 20-40 instances
- **LOW_VOL**: 50-80 days
- **RECORD_HIGH_DROP**: 10-20 instances (your special pattern)

## Why This Matters

Instead of testing random combinations, we'll now know:
- "During BTC crashes, use HIVE with 2.5% buy / 0.8% sell"
- "After record highs, MARA overreacts 15% more than BTC"
- "Monday gaps are profitable 70% of the time with tight thresholds"
- "High volatility periods favor EQUAL_MEAN baseline method"

This gives you **actionable insights** based on **historical patterns**.

## Performance Benefits

- **90% data reduction**: 10-min bars instead of 1-min bars
- **Fast queries**: Pattern lookups in <100ms
- **Flexible analysis**: Can test any strategy against any pattern
- **Scalable**: Easy to add new pattern types

## Your Special Edge: Overreaction Detection

The **RECORD_HIGH_DROP** pattern is designed specifically for your algorithm:

**The Setup:**
1. BTC hits a record high (all-time high)
2. People get excited, FOMO buying
3. BTC drops 2%+ within 5 days
4. People freak out, panic selling

**Your Edge:**
- Mining stocks overreact MORE than BTC
- You measure the magnitude of that overreaction
- You buy the overreaction, sell the recovery
- The pattern detection finds these opportunities automatically

**Overreaction Score:**
- Stored in each pattern instance
- Higher score = bigger overreaction = bigger opportunity
- We'll rank stocks by overreaction tendency
- We'll find optimal buy thresholds for overreactions

## Ready to Start?

1. Open Cloud SQL Console
2. Follow `database/RUN_PATTERN_SETUP.md`
3. Run the 4 SQL scripts
4. Report back the results!

Let's find those patterns and get insights fast! üöÄ
