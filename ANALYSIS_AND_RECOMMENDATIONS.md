# Trading Analysis Tools - Complete Analysis & Recommendations

## üéØ WHAT YOU HAVE NOW

### Current Desktop Testing Tools (Windows + SQL Server)

#### 1. **baseline_unified_app_fast_daily_btc_overlay_v2.py** (2,740 lines)
**Purpose**: Backtest different baseline methods and buy/sell thresholds
**Key Features**:
- Tests 5 baseline calculation methods (VWAP_RATIO, VOL_WEIGHTED, WINSORIZED, WEIGHTED_MEDIAN, EQUAL_MEAN)
- Simulates trading with different buy% and sell% thresholds
- Uses SQL Server database (local Windows machine)
- Streamlit UI for interactive testing
- Pre-joined minute data table for performance
- Calculates daily returns, trade counts, and performance metrics

**Current Limitations**:
- Windows-only (SQL Server Express)
- Desktop-only (not mobile-friendly)
- Limited to local machine
- No cloud scalability
- Manual data refresh

#### 2. **bitcorr_analyzer.py** (607 lines)
**Purpose**: Analyze correlation patterns and regime-based performance
**Key Features**:
- Analyzes Bitcoin correlation with mining stocks
- Regime detection (market conditions)
- Heatmaps for buy/sell threshold combinations
- Confidence scoring for predictions
- Daily winner analysis
- Policy backtesting

**Current Limitations**:
- Same Windows/SQL Server constraints
- Not integrated with live trading system
- Separate from main TRADIAC system

### Current TRADIAC Live Trading System (Google Cloud)
**Architecture**:
- Frontend: React + Firebase Hosting

- Uses ratio-based strategy (BTC price / Stock price)
- Calculates baselines and detects deviations
- Places automated trades via Alpaca
- Manages multiple wallets with different strategies

**What It Doesn't Have**:
- ‚ùå No backtesting tools integrated
- ‚ùå No optimization tools for finding best settings
- ‚ùå No mobile-friendly analysis interface
- ‚ùå No way to test millions of parameter combinations

## üèóÔ∏è RECOMMENDED ARCHITECTURE

### Technology Stack Decision

#### **Database: PostgreSQL + BigQuery Hybrid**

**PostgreSQL (Google Cloud SQL)** for:
- ‚úÖ Minute-level price data (already have this in TRADIAC)
- ‚úÖ Baseline calculations
- ‚úÖ Fast indexed queries
- ‚úÖ Real-time data access
- ‚úÖ Transaction data
- **Size**: ~13K rows/day √ó 365 days = ~5M rows/year (manageable)

**BigQuery** for:
- ‚úÖ Simulation results (millions of combinations)
- ‚úÖ Grid search results (symbol √ó method √ó buy% √ó sell% √ó date)
- ‚úÖ Aggregated analytics
- ‚úÖ Fast analytical queries on huge datasets
- ‚úÖ Cost-effective for large-scale analysis
- **Size**: Potentially billions of rows (symbol √ó method √ó threshold combinations √ó dates)

**Why Hybrid?**
- PostgreSQL: Fast for operational queries, real-time lookups
- BigQuery: Optimized for analytical queries, massive datasets, aggregations
- Best of both worlds: Speed + Scale

#### **Frontend: React + Material-UI**
- ‚úÖ Mobile-responsive design
- ‚úÖ Fast, modern UI
- ‚úÖ Reuse TRADIAC frontend patterns
- ‚úÖ Firebase Hosting (same as TRADIAC)

#### **Backend: Google Cloud Functions (Node.js)**
- ‚úÖ Serverless (no server management)
- ‚úÖ Auto-scaling
- ‚úÖ Pay only for what you use
- ‚úÖ Same stack as TRADIAC (easy integration)

## ‚ö° PERFORMANCE STRATEGY

### Speed Requirements: "Very Very Fast"

#### **Approach 1: Pre-computation (Recommended)**
- Run simulations overnight/weekly for common parameter ranges
- Store results in BigQuery
- UI queries pre-computed results (instant)
- On-demand simulations only for custom parameters

**Speed**: < 2 seconds for pre-computed results

#### **Approach 2: Optimized On-Demand**
- Use BigQuery's columnar storage
- Partition tables by date
- Cluster by symbol
- Use materialized views for common aggregations
- Parallel processing in Cloud Functions

**Speed**: 10-30 seconds for new simulations

#### **Approach 3: Hybrid (Best)**
- Pre-compute common scenarios (80% of queries)
- On-demand for custom parameters (20% of queries)
- Cache recent results
- Progressive loading (show partial results immediately)

**Speed**: < 2 seconds for common, < 30 seconds for custom

### Cost Optimization
- BigQuery: ~$5/TB queried (very cheap for analytical queries)
- Cloud Functions: ~$0.40/million invocations
- PostgreSQL: Fixed monthly cost (~$50-200/month depending on size)
- **Estimated monthly cost**: $100-300 for heavy usage

## ü§î QUESTIONS FOR YOU

Before we start building, I need to confirm:

1. **Database**: Are you comfortable with PostgreSQL + BigQuery hybrid? Or prefer all-PostgreSQL?

2. **Data Access**: Do you have access to the TRADIAC PostgreSQL database? Can we reuse that data?

3. **Budget**: Are you comfortable with ~$100-300/month for Google Cloud services?

4. **Timeline**: Is 8 weeks reasonable? Or do you need faster/slower?

5. **Priority**: Should we start with single simulation view or grid search view?

6. **Assumptions**: The "assume all orders fill" logic from your current tools - keep this for now?
