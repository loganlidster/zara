## 🔍 DETAILED ANALYSIS

### TOOL 1: baseline_unified_app_fast_daily.py - THE GOLD STANDARD

#### **Core Features Identified:**

1. **Single Simulation Mode**
   - Select: Symbol, Date Range, Baseline Method, Buy/Sell %
   - Output: Daily equity curve, summary metrics, trade log
   - Uses: `simulate_day_fast()` function (line 908)

2. **Batch Grid Search Mode** 
   - Tests ALL combinations: Symbols × Methods × Buy% × Sell%
   - Function: `run_grid_for_symbol()` (line 1013)
   - Optimization: Pre-fetches all data, processes in memory
   - Output: Best performers ranked by return

3. **Key Simulation Logic** (Lines 908-1000):
   ```python
   buy_thr = base_val * (1.0 + buy_pct / 100.0)   # Adjusted baseline for BUY
   sell_thr = base_val * (1.0 - sell_pct / 100.0) # Adjusted baseline for SELL
   
   if r >= buy_thr and pos <= 0 and cap > 0:  # BUY signal
       buy_sh = math.floor(cap / p)
       cap -= buy_sh * p
       pos = float(buy_sh)
   
   elif r <= sell_thr and pos > 0.0:  # SELL signal
       cap += pos * p
       pos = 0.0
   ```

4. **Baseline Calculation Methods** (5 types):
   - VWAP_RATIO: VWAP(BTC) / VWAP(Stock)
   - VOL_WEIGHTED: Volume-weighted average of ratios
   - WINSORIZED: Trim top/bottom 5%, then average
   - WEIGHTED_MEDIAN: Volume-weighted median
   - EQUAL_MEAN: Simple arithmetic mean

5. **Critical Features:**
   - **Lookback Period**: Uses previous N trading days for baseline
   - **Session Split**: Separate baselines for RTH vs AH
   - **Position Carryover**: Shares held overnight
   - **Trade Log Export**: Detailed CSV with every trade
   - **Participation Cap**: Limit order size by volume %

### TOOL 2: bitcorr_analyzer.py - PATTERN DETECTION

#### **9 Analysis Tabs Identified:**

**TAB 1: Overview**
- Quick stats: Rows, Days, Symbols, Methods
- Top methods by mean return
- Oracle equity curve (best per day)

**TAB 2: Regime Explorer** ⭐ **KEY INSIGHT**
- **Purpose**: Detect market conditions that predict performance
- **Regime Variables**:
  * `btc_prev_ret` - Previous day BTC return
  * `btc_prev_vol` - Previous day BTC volatility
  * `btc_overnight_ret` - Overnight BTC movement
  * `open_gap_z` - Opening gap Z-score
  * `liq_median` - Liquidity metric
- **Logic**: Bins data into quantiles, finds best action per regime
- **Output**: "When BTC had X% overnight return, use Y method with Z thresholds"

**TAB 3: Daily Winners**
- Shows best method/threshold combo for EACH day
- Win rate by method
- Equity curve of daily winners

**TAB 4: Heatmap (Buy×Sell)**

- **Correlation Metrics**:
  * `corr_pearson` - Pearson correlation (BTC vs Stock)
  * `corr_spearman` - Spearman correlation (rank-based)
  * `confidence` - Statistical confidence score
- **Multiple Horizons**: 0m, 5m, 10m, 15m (different lookback periods)
- **Purpose**: Measure how predictable the relationship is
- **High confidence** = More reliable baseline, better performance

**TAB 7: Policy ROI (Backtest)**
- Test adaptive policies
- "If confidence > X, use method Y"
- "If BTC volatility > Z, adjust thresholds"

**TAB 8: Export**
- CSV download of all results

### CRITICAL INSIGHTS - THE "WHY" BEHIND EACH TOOL

#### **1. Why Correlation Metrics Matter:**
```
High Pearson + High Spearman + High Confidence = Predictable day
→ Use tighter thresholds (0.5% buy, 1.0% sell)
→ More trades, higher win rate

Low correlation + Low confidence = Unpredictable day
→ Use wider thresholds (1.5% buy, 2.5% sell)
→ Fewer trades, avoid whipsaws
```

#### **2. Why Regime Detection Matters:**
```
BTC overnight return > +2% = Euphoria regime
→ Stock likely to overshoot
→ Use aggressive sell thresholds (1.0% sell)
→ Capture the overreaction

BTC overnight return < -2% = Panic regime
→ Stock likely to undershoot
→ Use aggressive buy thresholds (0.5% buy)
→ Buy the fear
```

#### **3. Why Multiple Baseline Methods Matter:**
```
WINSORIZED = Best for volatile stocks (removes outliers)
VOL_WEIGHTED = Best for liquid stocks (volume matters)
VWAP_RATIO = Best for stable relationships
EQUAL_MEAN = Baseline for comparison

Different stocks respond to different methods!
RIOT might work best with WINSORIZED
MARA might work best with VOL_WEIGHTED
```

#### **4. Why Daily Winners Analysis Matters:**
```
If WINSORIZED wins 15 out of 20 days for RIOT:
→ High consistency
→ Use WINSORIZED as default for RIOT

If no method wins consistently:
→ Stock is unpredictable
→ Use adaptive policy based on regime
```

### OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY FOR 100K+ SIMULATIONS

#### **Current Bottleneck:**
Running 81,000 simulations (9 stocks × 5 methods × 30 buy × 30 sell × 2 sessions) takes time.

#### **Solution: Pre-compute and Store**

**Step 1: Batch Simulation Runner**
```javascript
// Run all combinations for a date range
for each stock:
  for each method:
    for each session:
      for each buy_threshold:
        for each sell_threshold:
          run_simulation()
          calculate_metrics()
          calculate_correlations()
          calculate_regime_variables()
          INSERT INTO simulation_results
```

**Step 2: Materialized Views for Speed**
```sql
-- Pre-aggregate best performers
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW best_by_day AS
SELECT et_date, symbol, session, 
       method, buy_pct, sell_pct,
       day_return, confidence
FROM simulation_results
WHERE day_return = (
  SELECT MAX(day_return) 
  FROM simulation_results sr2 
  WHERE sr2.et_date = simulation_results.et_date
    AND sr2.symbol = simulation_results.symbol
    AND sr2.session = simulation_results.session
);

-- Pre-aggregate consistency by method
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW method_consistency AS
SELECT symbol, session, method,
       COUNT(*) as days_won,
       AVG(day_return) as avg_return,
       AVG(confidence) as avg_confidence
FROM best_by_day
GROUP BY symbol, session, method;
```

**Step 3: Incremental Updates**
- Only re-run simulations for new dates
- Keep historical results cached
- Update materialized views nightly
