# 🎉 SESSION COMPLETE - AMAZING PROGRESS!

## ✅ What We Accomplished Today

### 1. **Fixed Critical Simulator Bug** ⭐
- **Problem:** Simulator was using same-day baseline (look-ahead bias)
- **Solution:** Now uses previous trading day's baseline via `trading_calendar.prev_open_date`
- **Result:** Accurate, realistic simulations matching real trading conditions

### 2. **Imported Trading Calendar** 📅
- **1,828 trading days** imported (2023-2028)
- Includes prev_open_date and next_open_date fields
- Handles weekends and holidays correctly

### 3. **Calculated All Baselines** 📊
- **46,710 baselines** created!
- All 5 methods: EQUAL_MEAN, WEIGHTED_MEDIAN, VOL_WEIGHTED, WINSORIZED, VWAP_RATIO
- All 9 symbols: RIOT, MARA, CLSK, HUT, BTDR, CORZ, CIFR, CAN, HIVE
- Date range: Sept 1, 2023 to Oct 23, 2025
- **Verified accuracy** against your Python tool (perfect match!)

### 4. **Tested & Verified Simulator** ✅
- Ran multiple test cases
- Confirmed percentage calculations work correctly
- Results match expected behavior
- Ready for production use!

### 5. **Built Complete Web UI** 🎨
- **React Frontend** with beautiful dark theme
- **Express API Server** for simulations
- **Real-time results** with charts and metrics
- **Trade log** with complete details
- **Mobile-responsive** design
