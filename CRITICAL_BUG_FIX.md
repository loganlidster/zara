# CRITICAL BUG FIX - Fast Daily Ratio Logic

## The Problem
Fast Daily was comparing **stock price** to thresholds instead of **ratio (BTC/Stock)**.

### What Was Wrong
```javascript
// WRONG - was comparing stock price ($3-4) to threshold (~29,000)
const ratio = stockPrice / btcPrice;  // Also backwards!
if (stockPrice >= buyThr) {  // Stock price will NEVER be >= 29,000!
```

### Why It Failed
- Stock price: ~$3.78
- Buy threshold: ~29,676
- Condition: `if (3.78 >= 29676)` = ALWAYS FALSE
- Result: No trades ever found, 0 results

## The Fix
```javascript
// CORRECT - compare ratio to threshold
const ratio = btcPrice / stockPrice;  // BTC / Stock
if (ratio >= buyThr) {  // Compare ratio to threshold
```

### Example Calculation (HIVE 9/24/25)
**Baseline (from 9/23):** 29,520.68

**Thresholds:**
- Buy: 29,520.68 × 1.005 = 29,676.99
- Sell: 29,520.68 × 0.99 = 29,225.50

**At 9:30 AM:**
- BTC: $113,013.40
- Stock: $3.78
- Ratio: 113,013.40 / 3.78 = 29,897.72
- Decision: **BUY** (29,897.72 > 29,676.99) ✅

## Changes Made
1. **Ratio Calculation:** Changed from `stockPrice / btcPrice` to `btcPrice / stockPrice`
2. **Buy Condition:** Changed from `if (stockPrice >= buyThr)` to `if (ratio >= buyThr)`
3. **Sell Condition:** Changed from `if (stockPrice <= sellThr)` to `if (ratio <= sellThr)`

## Impact
- Fast Daily will now return results
- Logic matches the working Single Simulation report
- Correctly implements user's trading strategy

## Testing
After deployment, test with:
- Symbol: HIVE
- Date: 2025-09-24
- Method: EQUAL_MEAN
- Buy: 0.5%
- Sell: 1.0%
- Should find trades matching the working report

## Deployment
- Commit: 1a50b5d
- Status: Pushed to GitHub
- Auto-deploy: 2-5 minutes
