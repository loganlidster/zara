## üéØ What's Been Fixed

### ‚úÖ Critical Bug Fixed: Baseline Lookup
**Problem:** Simulator was using SAME day's baseline (incorrect)
**Solution:** Now uses PREVIOUS trading day's baseline via `trading_calendar.prev_open_date`

**Key Change in `simulator.js` (line ~27-40):**
```javascript
// OLD (WRONG):
INNER JOIN baseline_daily bl ON 
  bl.symbol = s.symbol 
  AND bl.trading_day = s.et_date  // ‚ùå Uses same day

// NEW (CORRECT):
INNER JOIN trading_calendar tc ON s.et_date = tc.cal_date
INNER JOIN baseline_daily bl ON 
  bl.symbol = s.symbol 
  AND bl.trading_day = tc.prev_open_date  // ‚úÖ Uses previous trading day
```

This matches your Python tool's logic: `prev_open_date` from trading calendar.

## üìÅ Files Ready for Download

### 1. Trading Calendar Import
- **import_calendar.js** - Node.js script to import calendar
- **import_calendar.sql** - SQL schema for calendar table
- **studio_results_20251024_0333.csv** - Calendar data (you already have this)

### 2. Fixed Simulation Engine
- **simulation-engine/src/core/simulator.js** - Fixed simulator with prev_open_date logic
- **simulation-engine/src/index.js** - CLI interface
- **simulation-engine/package.json** - Dependencies
- **simulation-engine/.env** - Database config

### 3. Documentation
- **STEP_BY_STEP_DEPLOYMENT.md** - Complete deployment guide
- **READY_TO_DEPLOY_PACKAGE.md** - This file

## üöÄ Quick Start (3 Commands)

Once you download the files:

```powershell
# 1. Import calendar (10 min)
cd C:\Users\logan\OneDrive\Desktop\tradiac-live\tradiac-testing
npm install pg
node import_calendar.js

# 2. Setup simulator (2 min)
cd simulation-engine
npm install

# 3. Test against known results (1 min)
node src/index.js BTDR 2025-09-24 2025-09-24 EQUAL_MEAN 0.5 1.1 RTH 10000
```

**Expected Result:** 10.53% return, 6 trades

---

## üîç What Changed in the Simulator

### Before (Incorrect):
```javascript
// Used same day's baseline
AND bl.trading_day = s.et_date
```

**Problem:** On Monday, it would use Monday's baseline, but Monday's baseline is calculated from Monday's data. This creates a look-ahead bias.

### After (Correct):
```javascript
// Uses previous trading day's baseline
INNER JOIN trading_calendar tc ON s.et_date = tc.cal_date
AND bl.trading_day = tc.prev_open_date
```

**Solution:** On Monday, it uses Friday's baseline (from `prev_open_date`). This matches real trading where you make decisions based on yesterday's analysis.

### Additional Improvements:
1. **Added `prev_baseline_date` to trade log** - Now you can verify which baseline was used
2. **Conservative pricing maintained** - Round up buys, round down sells
3. **Position carryover** - Positions carry overnight as expected
4. **Complete trade tracking** - Entry and exit pairs properly matched

## üìä Test Case Details

**From your CSV (studio_results_20251024_0333.csv):**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Symbol | BTDR |
| Date | 2025-09-24 |
| Method | EQUAL_MEAN |
| Buy % | 0.5% |
| Sell % | 1.1% |
| Expected Return | 10.53% |
| Expected Trades | 6 |
| Expected Baseline | 6481.94 (from prev day) |

**What to verify:**
1. ‚úÖ Return matches 10.53% (¬±0.1% acceptable due to rounding)
2. ‚úÖ Exactly 6 trades executed
3. ‚úÖ Each trade shows `prev_baseline_date` field
4. ‚úÖ Baseline value is from previous trading day

## üéØ Next Steps After Verification

Once the test passes, we'll build:

### Phase 1: Batch Grid Search (2-3 hours)
- Test all 81,000+ combinations
- Store results in `simulation_runs` table
- Generate performance heatmaps

### Phase 2: Advanced Analytics (2-3 hours)
- Correlation metrics (Pearson, Spearman)
- Regime detection (market conditions)
- Confidence scoring

### Phase 3: Web UI (4-6 hours)
- React dashboard
- Interactive visualizations
- Mobile-responsive design

### Phase 4: Optimization (2-3 hours)
- Pre-computation system
- Query optimization
- Caching layer

## üîß Technical Details

### Database Schema Used:
- `minute_stock` - Stock minute bars
- `minute_btc` - Bitcoin minute bars
- `baseline_daily` - Pre-calculated baselines (5 methods)
- `trading_calendar` - Trading days with prev/next dates ‚≠ê NEW

### Key Indexes:
- `idx_calendar_date` - Fast date lookups
- `idx_calendar_prev` - Fast prev_open_date joins
- `idx_calendar_is_open` - Filter trading days only

### Performance Considerations:
- Query uses 3 INNER JOINs (stock, btc, calendar, baseline)
- All joins are on indexed columns
- Expected query time: <2 seconds for single day
- Expected query time: <30 seconds for full year

## üìù Verification Checklist

Before moving to batch processing:

- [ ] Trading calendar imported (1,828 rows)
- [ ] Simulator runs without errors
- [ ] Test case returns 10.53% (¬±0.1%)
- [ ] Test case shows 6 trades
- [ ] Trade log shows `prev_baseline_date` field
- [ ] Baseline values match expected (6481.94)
- [ ] No look-ahead bias (using previous day's baseline)

---

## üí° Understanding the Fix

**Why this matters:**

In real trading, you can't use today's baseline to make today's decisions. You can only use information available BEFORE the trading day starts.

**Example:**
- **Monday 9:30 AM**: Market opens
- **You need**: Friday's baseline (calculated after Friday's close)
- **You have**: All of Friday's data
- **You DON'T have**: Monday's data (it's being created now!)

**The fix ensures:**
1. ‚úÖ No look-ahead bias
2. ‚úÖ Realistic trading simulation
3. ‚úÖ Matches your Python tool's logic
4. ‚úÖ Results are reproducible and verifiable
