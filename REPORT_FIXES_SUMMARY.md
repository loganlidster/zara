# Report Enhancement Fixes - Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Best Performer Report - Multi-Select & Per-Stock View

#### Frontend Changes (`frontend-dashboard/app/reports/best-performers/page.tsx`)
- **Removed "All" from SYMBOLS array** - now shows only actual stock symbols
- **Changed from single select to multi-select**:
  - Replaced `symbolFilter` state with `selectedSymbols` array
  - Default selection: ['HIVE', 'RIOT', 'MARA']
  - Added toggle buttons for each symbol
  - Added "Select All" and "Clear All" buttons
- **Added View Mode toggle**:
  - New state: `viewMode` ('overall' | 'per-stock')
  - Overall: Shows top N performers across all selected symbols
  - Per-stock: Shows top N performers for EACH symbol separately
- **Updated validation**:
  - Requires at least one symbol selected
  - Range testing now requires exactly one symbol (not multiple)
- **Updated results display**:
  - Overall view: Single table with all results
  - Per-stock view: Separate table for each symbol with grouped results

#### Backend Changes (`api-server/best-performers-two-step.js`)
- **Updated parameter handling**:
  - Changed from single `symbol` to `symbols` array
  - Added `viewMode` parameter support
- **Updated query logic**:
  - Per-stock mode: Queries each symbol separately, returns top N per symbol
  - Overall mode: Queries all symbols, sorts by score, returns top N overall
  - Handles comma-separated string or array for symbols parameter

### 2. Daily Curve & ROI Report - Session-Specific Baselines

#### Frontend Changes (`frontend-dashboard/app/reports/daily-curve/page.tsx`)
- **Updated API call logic**:
  - When session is "ALL" and using separate RTH/AH values:
    - Passes `rthBuyPct`, `rthSellPct`, `ahBuyPct`, `ahSellPct`
  - When using same values or single session:
    - Passes `buyPct`, `sellPct`
- **No UI changes needed** - the separate RTH/AH input fields already existed

#### API Types (`frontend-dashboard/lib/api.ts`)
- **Updated getDailyCurve interface**:
  - Made `buyPct` and `sellPct` optional
  - Added optional parameters: `rthBuyPct`, `rthSellPct`, `ahBuyPct`, `ahSellPct`

#### Backend Changes (`api-server/daily-curve-endpoint.js`)
- **Updated parameter extraction**:
  - Added `rthBuyPct`, `rthSellPct`, `ahBuyPct`, `ahSellPct` to destructuring
- **Updated validation logic**:
  - For ALL session: Accepts either single thresholds OR session-specific thresholds
  - For RTH/AH: Requires single thresholds
- **Updated fetchEventsForSymbol function**:
  - Added parameters for session-specific thresholds
  - When session is "ALL" with session-specific thresholds:
    - Queries both RTH and AH tables separately
    - Uses appropriate thresholds for each table
    - Merges results and sorts by date/time
  - When session is RTH or AH:
    - Queries single table as before

## Issues Resolved

### Issue #1: Best Performer - Multi-Select
✅ **FIXED**: Users can now select multiple symbols to run simultaneously
- Click symbols to toggle selection
- "Select All" and "Clear All" buttons for convenience
- Shows count of selected symbols

### Issue #2: Best Performer - Per-Stock Top Performers
✅ **FIXED**: Users can now view top performers for each stock separately
- Toggle between "Overall" and "Per-stock" view modes
- Per-stock mode shows top N for EACH symbol
- Prevents CAN from dominating all results

### Issue #3: Daily Curve - Session-Specific Baselines for ALL
✅ **FIXED**: When session is "ALL", can now use different baselines for RTH and AH
- Backend queries both RTH and AH tables with appropriate thresholds
- Merges events chronologically
- Uses RTH baseline for RTH events, AH baseline for AH events

### Issue #4: Daily Curve - ALL Mode Error
✅ **CLARIFIED**: The error "Range testing requires a specific symbol" was from Best Performers page, not Daily Curve
- Daily Curve ALL mode works correctly
- No changes needed for this issue

## Testing Checklist

### Best Performer Report
- [ ] Select multiple symbols (2-3) and verify results include all
- [ ] Toggle between "Overall" and "Per-stock" view modes
- [ ] Verify "Per-stock" shows separate tables for each symbol
- [ ] Verify "Overall" shows single sorted table
- [ ] Test "Select All" and "Clear All" buttons
- [ ] Verify range testing requires single symbol selection

### Daily Curve Report
- [ ] Select session "ALL"
- [ ] Uncheck "Use same values for RTH and AH"
- [ ] Enter different values for RTH and AH thresholds
- [ ] Click "Generate Curve"
- [ ] Verify chart displays correctly
- [ ] Verify no errors in console
- [ ] Test with multiple symbols selected

## Deployment Steps

1. **Commit changes to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: Add multi-select and per-stock view to Best Performers, add session-specific baselines to Daily Curve"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy Frontend to Vercel**:
   - Vercel will auto-deploy on push to main
   - Or manually trigger: `vercel --prod`

3. **Deploy Backend to Cloud Run**:
   ```bash
   cd api-server
   gcloud builds submit --config cloudbuild.yaml
   ```

4. **Verify deployment**:
   - Test Best Performers multi-select
   - Test Best Performers per-stock view
   - Test Daily Curve with session-specific thresholds

## Files Modified

### Frontend
- `frontend-dashboard/app/reports/best-performers/page.tsx` - Complete rewrite with multi-select and per-stock view
- `frontend-dashboard/app/reports/daily-curve/page.tsx` - Updated API call to pass session-specific parameters
- `frontend-dashboard/lib/api.ts` - Updated getDailyCurve interface

### Backend
- `api-server/best-performers-two-step.js` - Updated to handle multiple symbols and viewMode
- `api-server/daily-curve-endpoint.js` - Updated to handle session-specific baselines for ALL mode

### Documentation
- `REPORT_FIXES_PLAN.md` - Implementation plan
- `REPORT_FIXES_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## Technical Notes

### Best Performer Multi-Select Implementation
- Frontend sends array of symbols to backend
- Backend queries each symbol separately (for per-stock mode) or combined (for overall mode)
- Results are grouped by symbol in per-stock view
- Limit applies per-stock in per-stock mode, overall in overall mode

### Daily Curve Session-Specific Baselines
- When session="ALL" with separate thresholds:
  - Backend queries `trade_events_rth_{method}` with RTH thresholds
  - Backend queries `trade_events_ah_{method}` with AH thresholds
  - Results are merged chronologically
  - Each event uses its appropriate baseline (RTH or AH)
- This allows different trading strategies for different sessions
- Example: More aggressive in RTH (higher buy%), more conservative in AH (lower buy%)
