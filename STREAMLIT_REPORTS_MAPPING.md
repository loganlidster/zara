## Recommended Next Implementation

### **Grid Report** (Highest Priority)

This is the most valuable missing report for users:

**Why it's important:**
- Helps users find optimal buy%/sell% combinations
- Visualizes performance across parameter space
- Compares multiple baseline methods side-by-side
- Essential for strategy optimization

**Key Features to Implement:**
1. Single symbol selection
2. Multiple baseline method selection (checkboxes)
3. Buy% range inputs (min, max, step)
4. Sell% range inputs (min, max, step)
5. Date range selection
6. Session selection (RTH/AH/ALL)
7. Results display:
   - Heatmap for each method showing ROI by buy%/sell% combination
   - Best combination for each method
   - Comparison table across methods
   - Export to CSV

**Estimated Complexity:** Medium
**Estimated Time:** 3-4 hours
