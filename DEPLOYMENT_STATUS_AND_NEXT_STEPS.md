## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

### Backend Deployment (Required for Both Reports)

**Option 1: Google Cloud Console (Recommended)**
1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds?project=tradiac-testing
2. Click "Run" or "Trigger Build"
3. Select repository: `github_loganlidster_zara`
4. Branch: `main`
5. Wait 3-5 minutes for deployment

**Option 2: Command Line (if gcloud installed)**
```bash
gcloud builds submit --config=api-server/cloudbuild.yaml
```

### Verification Steps

**After Backend Deployment:**

1. **Test Multi-Stock Daily Curve**:
   - Go to: https://frontend-dashboard-qg2zw2tnm-logans-projects-57bfdedc.vercel.app/reports/multi-stock-daily-curve
   - Add 2-3 stocks with different settings
   - Click "Run Simulation"
   - Verify chart and table display correctly

2. **Test Real vs Projected**:
   - Go to: https://frontend-dashboard-qg2zw2tnm-logans-projects-57bfdedc.vercel.app/reports/real-vs-projected
   - Select a wallet from dropdown
   - Set date range (e.g., Oct 1-31, 2024)
   - Click "Compare Results"
   - Verify projected vs actual comparison displays

3. **Test Wallets Endpoint**:
   ```bash
   curl https://tradiac-api-941257247637.us-central1.run.app/api/wallets
   ```
   Should return list of wallets from live database

## üéØ What Each Report Does

### Multi-Stock Daily Curve
**Problem Solved**: You had to run Daily Curve 11 times manually and write down results

**Solution**: Run once with all 11 stocks configured
- Each stock: Independent $10,000 capital
- Each stock: Unique RTH/AH buy/sell settings
- Each stock: Different baseline method
- Result: Combined chart + summary table

**Use Cases**:
- Compare all your live trading stocks at once
- Test different configurations side-by-side
- Quickly see which stocks are performing best

### Real vs Projected
**Problem Solved**: No way to validate if simulations match reality

**Solution**: Compare simulated results against actual Alpaca trades
- Load wallet settings from live database
- Run simulation with those settings
- Fetch actual Alpaca orders for same period
- Calculate slippage on every trade
- Identify missed/expired orders

**Use Cases**:
- Validate your trading strategy
- Measure actual execution costs (slippage)
- Identify why actual differs from projected
- Build confidence in simulations
- Optimize settings based on real performance

## üìà Expected Benefits

### Time Savings
- **Before**: 30 minutes to run 11 Daily Curve reports manually
- **After**: 2 minutes to run Multi-Stock Daily Curve once
- **Savings**: 28 minutes per analysis session

### Accuracy Improvements
- **Before**: No way to measure actual slippage
- **After**: Precise slippage measurement on every trade
- **Result**: More accurate future projections

### Strategy Validation
- **Before**: Uncertainty if simulations match reality
- **After**: Direct comparison of projected vs actual
- **Result**: Confidence in trading decisions

## üîß Technical Details

### Database Connections
**Testing Database** (existing):
- Host: 34.41.97.179
- Database: tradiac_testing
- Tables: minute_stock, minute_btc, baseline_daily, trade_events_*

**Live Database** (new):
- Host: 35.199.155.114
- Database: tradiac
- Tables: wallets, wallet_symbols, execution_orders

### API Integrations
**Alpaca Paper Trading**:
- API Key: PKM9CGRKTW3SVUT19YQB
- Base URL: https://paper-api.alpaca.markets
- Endpoints: /v2/orders, /v2/account, /v2/positions

### Method Name Mapping
Live database uses different names than testing database:
- MEDIAN ‚Üí WEIGHTED_MEDIAN
- EQUAL_MEAN ‚Üí EQUAL_MEAN (same)
- VWAP_RATIO ‚Üí VWAP_RATIO (same)
- VOL_WEIGHTED ‚Üí VOL_WEIGHTED (same)
- WINSORIZED ‚Üí WINSORIZED (same)

## üêõ Known Limitations

### Multi-Stock Daily Curve
1. Uses "ALL" session mode (combines RTH + AH)
2. Each stock uses single method (not session-specific yet)
3. No portfolio-level statistics (just per-stock)

### Real vs Projected
1. Trade matching uses 1-hour time window
2. Equity curve calculation simplified (uses last trade price)
3. Only matches filled orders (ignores partial fills)
4. Slippage calculation assumes same-day execution

## üîÆ Future Enhancements (Optional)

### Phase 4: Enhanced Visualizations
- Dual equity curve chart (projected vs actual)
- Interactive trade markers on chart
- Zoom/pan functionality
- Export chart as image

### Phase 5: Slippage Database
- Store all slippage measurements in database
- Build historical slippage patterns
- Use for future slippage predictions
- Generate slippage reports by symbol/time

### Phase 6: Advanced Features
- Real-time monitoring of live trades
- Alerts when actual diverges from projected
- Automatic strategy optimization
- Portfolio-level risk metrics

## üìù Testing Checklist

Before using in production:
