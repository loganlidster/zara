# Multi-Stock Daily Curve Report - Complete Summary

## Overview
Built a new report that allows you to run Daily Curve simulations for multiple stocks simultaneously, each with independent settings. This eliminates the need to run the Daily Curve report 11 times manually and write down results.

## Problem Solved
**Before**: To compare 11 stocks, you had to:
1. Run Daily Curve report for BTDR with its settings
2. Write down the results
3. Run Daily Curve report for RIOT with its settings
4. Write down the results
5. Repeat 9 more times...
6. Manually compare all results

**After**: Run Multi-Stock Daily Curve once with all 11 stocks configured, see all results side-by-side in one chart and table.

## Key Features

### 1. Independent Simulations
- Each stock starts with **$10,000** (separate portfolios)
- Each stock has **unique RTH and AH settings**
- **No interaction** between stocks (CIFR trades don't affect CAN)
- Exactly like running Daily Curve 11 times, but automated

### 2. Individual Stock Configuration
Each stock can be configured with:
- **Symbol** (HIVE, RIOT, MARA, etc.)
- **Method** (EQUAL_MEAN, VWAP_RATIO, VOL_WEIGHTED, WINSORIZED, WEIGHTED_MEDIAN)
- **RTH Buy %** (e.g., 0.5%)
- **RTH Sell %** (e.g., 0.5%)
- **AH Buy %** (e.g., 0.5%)
- **AH Sell %** (e.g., 0.5%)
- **Enable/Disable** toggle

### 3. Global Settings
- **Date Range** (start date, end date)
- **Slippage %** (applies to all stocks)
- **Conservative Rounding** (applies to all stocks)

### 4. Preset Management
- **"Load Live Settings"** button - Loads your current 11-stock configuration
- **"Add Stock"** button - Add more stocks dynamically
- **"Remove"** button - Remove individual stocks
- **"Select All" / "Deselect All"** - Quick enable/disable

### 5. Results Visualization
- **Combined Performance Chart**: All stocks on one graph with distinct colors
- **Summary Statistics Table**: Sortable by return %, trades, win rate
- **CSV Export**: Download all results for further analysis

## Technical Implementation

### Backend
**File**: `api-server/multi-stock-daily-curve-endpoint.js` (~350 lines)

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/multi-stock-daily-curve`

**Request Format**:
```json
{
  "startDate": "2024-10-01",
  "endDate": "2024-10-31",
  "slippagePct": 0.1,
  "conservativeRounding": true,
  "stocks": [
    {
      "symbol": "BTDR",
      "method": "WEIGHTED_MEDIAN",
      "rthBuyPct": 0.5,
      "rthSellPct": 0.5,
      "ahBuyPct": 0.5,
      "ahSellPct": 0.5
    },
    {
      "symbol": "RIOT",
      "method": "EQUAL_MEAN",
      "rthBuyPct": 0.6,
      "rthSellPct": 0.4,
      "ahBuyPct": 0.7,
      "ahSellPct": 0.3
    }
    // ... more stocks
  ]
}
```

**Processing Logic**:
1. Validate all stock configurations
2. For each stock:
   - Query `trade_events_all_{method}` table
   - Filter events by session-specific thresholds
   - Simulate wallet starting at $10,000
   - Apply slippage and conservative rounding
   - Calculate equity curve and statistics
3. Aggregate all results
4. Return combined response

**Response Format**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "dateRange": { "startDate": "2024-10-01", "endDate": "2024-10-31" },
  "results": [
    {
      "symbol": "BTDR",
      "method": "WEIGHTED_MEDIAN",
      "dates": ["2024-10-01", "2024-10-02", ...],
      "equityCurve": [10000, 10050, 10120, ...],
      "summary": {
        "totalReturn": 4436.96,
        "totalReturnPct": 144.37,
        "totalTrades": 158,
        "winRate": 68.4,
        "avgTrade": 2.15,
        "finalEquity": 24436.96
      }
    }
    // ... more stocks
  ]
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Your Current Live Settings
```javascript
Load Live Settings → Runs with:
- BTDR (WEIGHTED_MEDIAN): RTH 0.5%/0.5%, AH 0.5%/0.5%
- RIOT (EQUAL_MEAN): RTH 0.6%/0.4%, AH 0.7%/0.3%
- MARA (VWAP_RATIO): RTH 0.5%/0.5%, AH 0.6%/0.4%
- ... 8 more stocks
```

### Example 2: Testing New Strategy
```javascript
Add 1 stock:
- HIVE (EQUAL_MEAN): RTH 1.0%/1.0%, AH 0.5%/0.5%

Compare against current settings
```

### Example 3: Method Comparison
```javascript
Add 5 stocks (same symbol, different methods):
- MARA (EQUAL_MEAN): RTH 0.5%/0.5%, AH 0.5%/0.5%
- MARA (VWAP_RATIO): RTH 0.5%/0.5%, AH 0.5%/0.5%
- MARA (VOL_WEIGHTED): RTH 0.5%/0.5%, AH 0.5%/0.5%
- MARA (WINSORIZED): RTH 0.5%/0.5%, AH 0.5%/0.5%
- MARA (WEIGHTED_MEDIAN): RTH 0.5%/0.5%, AH 0.5%/0.5%

See which method performs best for MARA
```

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Backend**: Trigger Cloud Build to deploy new endpoint
2. **Test Report**: Run with your live settings
3. **Verify Results**: Compare against manual Daily Curve runs
4. **Customize Preset**: Update "Load Live Settings" with your actual settings
5. **Use Daily**: Replace manual 11-run process with this report

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

If you want additional features:
- Save/load multiple presets (not just "Live Settings")
- Portfolio-level statistics (combined equity across all stocks)
- Trade-by-trade log across all stocks
- Performance ranking by different metrics
- Correlation analysis between stocks
- Risk metrics (Sharpe ratio, max drawdown)

---

**Status**: ✅ Complete and ready for deployment  
**Impact**: Saves ~30 minutes per analysis session
