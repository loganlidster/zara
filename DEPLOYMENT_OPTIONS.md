## Option 1: Vercel (RECOMMENDED - Easiest & Fastest)

### Why Vercel?
- Built specifically for Next.js
- Automatic deployments from GitHub
- Free SSL certificate
- Takes 5 minutes total
- Zero configuration needed

### Steps:
1. **Go to Vercel**: https://vercel.com/signup
2. **Sign in with GitHub**
3. **Import your repository**: `loganlidster/zara`
4. **Configure:**
   - Framework Preset: Next.js
   - Root Directory: `frontend-dashboard`
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `.next`
5. **Deploy** (takes 2 minutes)
6. **Add Custom Domain:**
   - Go to Project Settings → Domains
   - Add `raas.help`
   - Vercel will show you DNS records to add
7. **Update GoDaddy DNS:**
   - Add A record: `76.76.21.21`
   - Add CNAME record: `cname.vercel-dns.com`
8. **Done!** SSL is automatic

**Result:** https://raas.help (live in 5 minutes)

## Option 2: Firebase Hosting (You Already Have This)

### Why Firebase?
- You already have the project set up
- Free SSL certificate
- Global CDN
- Good for static sites

### Steps:
1. **Update firebase.json** to point to Next.js build
2. **Export Next.js as static site** (add to next.config.js: `output: 'export'`)
3. **Deploy to Firebase:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend-dashboard
   npm run build
   firebase deploy --only hosting
   ```
4. **Add Custom Domain in Firebase Console:**
   - Go to Hosting → Add custom domain
   - Enter `raas.help`
   - Firebase will show DNS records
5. **Update GoDaddy DNS:**
   - Add A records (Firebase will provide IPs)
   - Add TXT record for verification
6. **Wait for SSL** (takes 24 hours)

**Result:** https://raas.help

## My Recommendation: Use Vercel

**Why?**
- Faster setup (5 minutes vs 30 minutes)
- Better for Next.js (Firebase is better for static sites)
- Automatic deployments on every git push
- Instant SSL (no 24-hour wait)
- Free preview URLs for every branch

**Next Steps:**
1. I can prepare the Vercel deployment configuration
2. You sign up for Vercel with GitHub
3. Import the repo and deploy
4. Add raas.help domain
5. Update DNS in GoDaddy

Would you like me to prepare the Vercel deployment files?
