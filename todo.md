# Pattern Analysis System - Implementation Checklist

## Phase 1: Database Setup ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] User runs `create_pattern_analysis_tables.sql` in Cloud SQL
- [x] Fixed `populate_btc_aggregated.sql` to use correct column names (et_date, et_time, close, high, low)
- [x] User confirmed fixed version is in workspace
- [x] User runs `populate_btc_aggregated.sql` in Cloud SQL (SUCCESS)
- [x] User runs `populate_daily_btc_context.sql` in Cloud SQL (SUCCESS)
- [x] Fixed `detect_patterns.sql` to use correct column names
- [x] User runs `detect_patterns.sql` in Cloud SQL (SUCCESS)
- [x] User reports pattern counts - 17,430 total patterns detected:
  - CRASH: 14,394 instances
  - SURGE: 2,733 instances
  - LOW_VOL: 269 instances
  - RECORD_HIGH_DROP: 20 instances ⭐
  - MONDAY_GAP: 11 instances
  - HIGH_VOL: 3 instances

## Phase 2: API Endpoints ⏳ IN PROGRESS
- [x] Create `/api/patterns/summary` endpoint (get all pattern types with stats)
- [x] Create `/api/patterns/instances` endpoint (get instances of a pattern type)
- [x] Create `/api/patterns/overreactions` endpoint (record high drops ranked by overreaction score)
- [x] Create `/api/patterns/details/:patternId` endpoint (get specific pattern details)
- [x] Create `/api/patterns/types` endpoint (list available pattern types)
- [x] Create `/api/patterns/date-range` endpoint (get date range of patterns)
- [x] Add pattern endpoints to server.js
- [ ] Test all endpoints locally
- [ ] Deploy to Cloud Run
- [ ] Verify endpoints work in production

## Phase 3: Dashboard Reports (After Phase 2 Complete)
- [ ] Create Pattern Overview report (list all 6 pattern types)
- [ ] Create Pattern Deep Dive report (drill down into specific pattern)
- [ ] Create Overreaction Analysis report (focus on RECORD_HIGH_DROP)
- [ ] Add Pattern Analysis card to home page
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel
- [ ] User testing and feedback

## Phase 4: Performance Analysis (After Phase 3 Complete)
- [ ] Build script to run Best Performers for each pattern instance
- [ ] Populate `pattern_performance` table with results
- [ ] Calculate consistency scores across patterns
- [ ] Generate insights and recommendations
- [ ] Update dashboard with performance data

## Phase 5: Refinement (Ongoing)
- [ ] Adjust pattern thresholds based on results
- [ ] Add more pattern types if needed
- [ ] Optimize queries for performance
- [ ] Add caching for frequently accessed patterns
- [ ] Create automated daily pattern detection

## Current Status
**Waiting on:** User to run 4 SQL scripts in Cloud SQL (Phase 1)

**Files Ready:**
- ✅ database/create_pattern_analysis_tables.sql - Creates 4 tables
- ✅ database/populate_btc_aggregated.sql - Aggregates BTC data (90% reduction)
- ✅ database/populate_daily_btc_context.sql - Calculates daily metrics
- ✅ database/detect_patterns.sql - Detects 6 pattern types
- ✅ database/verify_pattern_setup.sql - Verification queries
- ✅ SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md - Step-by-step guide
- ✅ PATTERN_ANALYSIS_SYSTEM.md - Complete system documentation
- ✅ PATTERN_ANALYSIS_READY.md - Summary of what's ready

**Estimated Time:**
- Phase 1: 3-5 minutes (user action)
- Phase 2: 2-3 hours (API development)
- Phase 3: 3-4 hours (dashboard development)
- Phase 4: 1-2 hours (performance analysis)
- Phase 5: Ongoing

**Next Action:** User runs SQL scripts and reports results

**Instructions:** See SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md for detailed step-by-step guide
