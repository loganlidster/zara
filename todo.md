# Tradiac Buy/Sell Logic Review - COMPLETED âœ…

## Analysis Phase
- [x] Review current buy/sell logic implementation in backend
- [x] Compare implemented logic with user's described logic
- [x] Identify any discrepancies in the calculation or comparison logic
- [x] Document findings

### FINDINGS:
The buy/sell logic was INVERTED:
- Was: buyThr = baseline * (1 - adjustment) and triggers when price <= buyThr
- Fixed: buyThr = baseline * (1 + adjustment) and triggers when price >= buyThr
- Was: sellThr = baseline * (1 + adjustment) and triggers when price >= sellThr  
- Fixed: sellThr = baseline * (1 - adjustment) and triggers when price <= sellThr

## Fix Phase
- [x] Correct any logic errors found
  - Fixed api-server/fast-daily-endpoint.js
  - Fixed processor/nightly-processor-dual.js
- [x] Document the fix in BUY_SELL_LOGIC_FIX.md
- [x] Commit and push changes to GitHub

## Deployment Status
- [x] API Server deployed successfully to Cloud Run (fix is LIVE!)
- [x] Simplified Cloud Build configuration (API only)
- [x] Specified project ID (tradiac-testing-66f6e) in Cloud Build
- [x] All changes pushed to GitHub
- [x] Created DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE.md with full documentation
- [x] Created PROJECT_CONSOLIDATION_GUIDE.md for project setup

## Ready for Testing
The corrected logic is now live and ready for user testing to verify:
- Expected 5 trades (instead of incorrect results)
- Expected +4.6% ROI (instead of -4.6%)
- All trade triggers at correct price points

## Documentation Created
- BUY_SELL_LOGIC_FIX.md - Detailed explanation of the fix
- DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE.md - Deployment summary and testing guide
- PROJECT_CONSOLIDATION_GUIDE.md - Guide for managing two projects
