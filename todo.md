# Event-Based Trade Logging Implementation

## STATUS: Core Implementation Complete ✅
All core components are implemented and ready for deployment.
See DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md for deployment steps.

## 1. Database Schema Design
- [x] Create `trade_events` table schema
  - Columns: symbol, method, session, buy_pct, sell_pct, event_timestamp, event_type (BUY/SELL), price, shares, cash_balance, position_value, total_value
  - Composite primary key or unique constraint on (symbol, method, session, buy_pct, sell_pct, event_timestamp)
  - Indexes for efficient querying
- [x] Create `simulation_metadata` table
  - Track which combinations have been processed
  - Store start_date, end_date, last_processed_date for each combination
- [x] Write SQL migration script

## 2. Event-Based Processor
- [x] Create `processor/event-based-processor.js`
  - Fetch all minute data for symbol/method/session ONCE
  - For each buy/sell combination:
    - Run continuous simulation from start to end
    - Log only BUY and SELL events (not every minute)
    - Track wallet state continuously (positions carry overnight)
  - Batch insert events to database
- [x] Add progress tracking and resumability
- [x] Add error handling and logging

## 3. Query API for Event Data
- [x] Create `/api/events/query` endpoint
  - Accept: symbol, method, session, buy_pct, sell_pct, start_date, end_date
  - Return: all trade events in date range
  - Calculate: total return, number of trades, win rate
- [x] Create `/api/events/summary` endpoint
  - Aggregate statistics for date range
  - Return: ROI, total trades, final portfolio value
- [x] Add caching for frequently queried ranges

## 4. Update Existing Endpoints
- [ ] Modify Fast Daily to use event data (optional - can keep both)
- [ ] Modify Batch Daily to use event data (optional - can keep both)
- [ ] Modify Batch Grid Search to use event data (optional - can keep both)
- [ ] Ensure backward compatibility during transition

## 5. Historical Data Processing (Ready to Execute)
- [ ] Deploy database schema to Cloud SQL (script ready: database/create_event_tables.sql)
- [ ] Deploy API code to Cloud Run (git push will trigger Cloud Build)
- [ ] Test endpoints with test-event-system.sh (script ready)
- [ ] Run event-based processor for all combinations (script ready)
  - 11 symbols × 5 methods × 3 sessions × 900 combos = 148,500 simulations
  - Expected time: ~2 hours for full year
- [ ] Verify data accuracy with verify-data.sql (script ready)
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerts

## 6. Automation Setup (Future)
- [ ] Create nightly processor script
  - Run at 1 AM EST
  - Process previous trading day for all combinations
  - Update simulation_metadata
- [ ] Set up Cloud Scheduler job
- [ ] Add email notifications for failures

## 7. Testing & Validation
- [ ] Test event logging accuracy on small date range
- [ ] Compare results with old daily-based system
- [ ] Verify wallet continuity across days
- [ ] Load test query endpoints
- [ ] Test edge cases (market holidays, gaps, etc.)

## 8. Documentation
- [x] Document new table schemas
- [x] Document API endpoints
- [x] Create migration guide
- [x] Update deployment procedures
