# Pattern Analysis System - Implementation Checklist

## Phase 1: Database Setup ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] User runs `create_pattern_analysis_tables.sql` in Cloud SQL
- [x] Fixed `populate_btc_aggregated.sql` to use correct column names (et_date, et_time, close, high, low)
- [x] User confirmed fixed version is in workspace
- [x] User runs `populate_btc_aggregated.sql` in Cloud SQL (SUCCESS)
- [x] User runs `populate_daily_btc_context.sql` in Cloud SQL (SUCCESS)
- [x] Fixed `detect_patterns.sql` to use correct column names
- [x] User runs `detect_patterns.sql` in Cloud SQL (SUCCESS)
- [x] User reports pattern counts - 17,430 total patterns detected:
  - CRASH: 14,394 instances
  - SURGE: 2,733 instances
  - LOW_VOL: 269 instances
  - RECORD_HIGH_DROP: 20 instances ⭐
  - MONDAY_GAP: 11 instances
  - HIGH_VOL: 3 instances

## Phase 2: API Endpoints ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Create `/api/patterns/summary` endpoint (get all pattern types with stats)
- [x] Create `/api/patterns/instances` endpoint (get instances of a pattern type)
- [x] Create `/api/patterns/overreactions` endpoint (record high drops ranked by overreaction score)
- [x] Create `/api/patterns/details/:patternId` endpoint (get specific pattern details)
- [x] Create `/api/patterns/types` endpoint (list available pattern types)
- [x] Create `/api/patterns/date-range` endpoint (get date range of patterns)
- [x] Add pattern endpoints to server.js
- [x] Commit and push to GitHub
- [x] Auto-deploy to Cloud Run via Cloud Build (in progress)

## Phase 3: Dashboard Reports ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Create Pattern Overview report (list all 6 pattern types)
- [x] Create Pattern Deep Dive report (drill down into specific pattern)
- [x] Create Overreaction Analysis report (focus on RECORD_HIGH_DROP)
- [x] Add Pattern Analysis card to home page
- [x] Deploy to Vercel (https://raas.help)
- [ ] User testing and feedback

## Phase 4: Custom Pattern Builder & Forward Testing ⏳ DEPLOYING
- [x] Build custom pattern detection API endpoint
  - [x] POST /api/patterns/custom-detect (find matches for user-defined patterns)
  - [x] Support direction (surge/drop), magnitude (%), timeframe (hours)
  - [x] Query btc_aggregated for matching date ranges
- [x] Build strategy analysis with offset support
  - [x] POST /api/patterns/analyze-custom (analyze strategies for matches)
  - [x] Support offset: 0 (during), +1 (day after), +2 (2 days after), +3 (3 days after)
  - [x] Run Best Performers for each match + offset
  - [x] Aggregate results and calculate win rates
- [x] Build Custom Pattern Analyzer dashboard
  - [x] Pattern builder form (direction, magnitude, timeframe)
  - [x] "Find Patterns" button to detect matches
  - [x] Results table showing all matching dates
  - [x] Strategy analysis tabs (During, +1, +2, +3)
  - [x] Best/worst performers by stock and session
  - [x] Win rate and consistency metrics
- [x] Fix ES module import issues (all imports moved to top)
- [ ] Deploy API to Cloud Run (in progress - Cloud Build running)
- [x] Deploy dashboard to Vercel (https://raas.help)
- [ ] User testing and feedback

## Phase 5: Refinement (Ongoing)
- [ ] Adjust pattern thresholds based on results
- [ ] Add more pattern types if needed
- [ ] Optimize queries for performance
- [ ] Add caching for frequently accessed patterns
- [ ] Create automated daily pattern detection

## Current Status
**Waiting on:** User to run 4 SQL scripts in Cloud SQL (Phase 1)

**Files Ready:**
- ✅ database/create_pattern_analysis_tables.sql - Creates 4 tables
- ✅ database/populate_btc_aggregated.sql - Aggregates BTC data (90% reduction)
- ✅ database/populate_daily_btc_context.sql - Calculates daily metrics
- ✅ database/detect_patterns.sql - Detects 6 pattern types
- ✅ database/verify_pattern_setup.sql - Verification queries
- ✅ SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md - Step-by-step guide
- ✅ PATTERN_ANALYSIS_SYSTEM.md - Complete system documentation
- ✅ PATTERN_ANALYSIS_READY.md - Summary of what's ready

**Estimated Time:**
- Phase 1: 3-5 minutes (user action)
- Phase 2: 2-3 hours (API development)
- Phase 3: 3-4 hours (dashboard development)
- Phase 4: 1-2 hours (performance analysis)
- Phase 5: Ongoing

**Next Action:** User runs SQL scripts and reports results

**Instructions:** See SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md for detailed step-by-step guide
