# Tradiac Buy/Sell Logic Review - COMPLETED

## Analysis Phase
- [x] Review current buy/sell logic implementation in backend
- [x] Compare implemented logic with user's described logic
- [x] Identify any discrepancies in the calculation or comparison logic
- [x] Document findings

### FINDINGS:
The buy/sell logic was INVERTED:
- Was: buyThr = baseline * (1 - adjustment) and triggers when price <= buyThr
- Fixed: buyThr = baseline * (1 + adjustment) and triggers when price >= buyThr
- Was: sellThr = baseline * (1 + adjustment) and triggers when price >= sellThr  
- Fixed: sellThr = baseline * (1 - adjustment) and triggers when price <= sellThr

## Fix Phase
- [x] Correct any logic errors found
  - Fixed api-server/fast-daily-endpoint.js
  - Fixed processor/nightly-processor-dual.js
- [x] Document the fix in BUY_SELL_LOGIC_FIX.md
- [x] Commit and push changes to GitHub

## Deployment Status
- [x] API Server deployed successfully to Cloud Run (fix is LIVE!)
- [x] Simplified Cloud Build configuration (API only)
- [x] All changes pushed to GitHub

## Testing Phase
- [ ] User to test the corrected logic with their hand calculations
- [ ] User to verify the fix produces expected results (5 trades, +4.6% ROI)
