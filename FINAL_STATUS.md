# Tradiac Buy/Sell Logic Fix - Final Status

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Your Fix is Live!

Your buy/sell logic fix has been successfully deployed to Cloud Run.

---

## Your Architecture (Correct Setup)

### Backend Project: `tradiac-testing`
- **Cloud SQL Database**: PostgreSQL at `34.41.97.179`
- **Cloud Run API**: `tradiac-api` service ‚Üê **Your fix is HERE!**
- **Cloud Build**: Automatic deployment on GitHub push

### Frontend Project: `tradiac-testing-66f6e`
- **Firebase Hosting**: Web UI

---

## What Was Fixed

### The Problem
The buy/sell thresholds were **inverted**, causing:
- Buying when prices were LOW (should buy when HIGH)
- Selling when prices were HIGH (should sell when LOW)

### The Solution
Corrected threshold calculations in:
1. `api-server/fast-daily-endpoint.js`
2. `processor/nightly-processor-dual.js`

### Code Changes
```javascript
// BEFORE (WRONG):
const buyThreshold = baseline * (1 - buyAdjustment);   // Too low
const sellThreshold = baseline * (1 + sellAdjustment); // Too high
if (price <= buyThreshold) { /* buy */ }               // Wrong direction
if (price >= sellThreshold) { /* sell */ }             // Wrong direction

// AFTER (CORRECT):
const buyThreshold = baseline * (1 + buyAdjustment);   // Correctly high
const sellThreshold = baseline * (1 - sellAdjustment); // Correctly low
if (price >= buyThreshold) { /* buy */ }               // Correct direction
if (price <= sellThreshold) { /* sell */ }             // Correct direction
```
