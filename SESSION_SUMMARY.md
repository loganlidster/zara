# 🎯 SESSION SUMMARY - Day 2 Continuation

## ✅ What We Accomplished This Session

### 1. **Reviewed Project Status**
- Confirmed Day 1 completion (database, data pipeline, initial simulator)
- Identified critical bug: simulator using same-day baseline instead of previous day
- Reviewed all documentation from previous session

### 2. **Fixed Critical Simulator Bug** ⭐
**The Problem:**
```javascript
// WRONG: Uses same day's baseline (look-ahead bias)
AND bl.trading_day = s.et_date
```

**The Solution:**
```javascript
// CORRECT: Uses previous trading day's baseline
INNER JOIN trading_calendar tc ON s.et_date = tc.cal_date
AND bl.trading_day = tc.prev_open_date
```

This matches your Python tool's logic and eliminates look-ahead bias.

### 3. **Created Trading Calendar Import System**
- Built Node.js script to import 1,828 trading days
- Includes prev_open_date and next_open_date fields
- Handles weekends and holidays correctly
- Ready to run locally (can't connect from sandbox)

### 4. **Prepared Complete Deployment Package**
All files ready for download and deployment:
- ✅ Trading calendar import scripts
- ✅ Fixed simulation engine
- ✅ Step-by-step deployment guide
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

## 🔍 The Critical Fix Explained

### Why This Matters:

**Scenario: Trading on Monday, October 20, 2025**

**WRONG (Before Fix):**
```
Monday 9:30 AM: Market opens
Simulator uses: Monday's baseline
Problem: Monday's baseline is calculated FROM Monday's data
Result: Look-ahead bias (using future information)
```

**CORRECT (After Fix):**
```
Monday 9:30 AM: Market opens
Simulator uses: Friday's baseline (from prev_open_date)
Reason: Friday's baseline was calculated after Friday's close
Result: No look-ahead bias (using only past information)
```

### Real-World Example:

**Test Case: BTDR on 2025-09-24**
- Trading Day: September 24, 2025 (Wednesday)
- Previous Trading Day: September 23, 2025 (Tuesday)
- Baseline Used: September 23's baseline (6481.94)
- Expected Return: 10.53%
- Expected Trades: 6

The simulator now correctly uses September 23's baseline to make September 24's trading decisions.

## 🎯 Test Case Verification

**Command to run:**
```powershell
node src/index.js BTDR 2025-09-24 2025-09-24 EQUAL_MEAN 0.5 1.1 RTH 10000
```

**Expected Output:**
```
🎯 Running simulation for BTDR
   Method: EQUAL_MEAN, Buy: 0.5%, Sell: 1.1%
   Period: 2025-09-24 to 2025-09-24
   Session: RTH, Capital: $10000
   Found XXX bars to process

📊 Results:
   Final Equity: $11053.00
   Total Return: 10.53%
   Trades: 6 (3 completed)
   Win Rate: XX.XX%

✅ Simulation complete!
```

**What to verify:**
1. ✅ Return is 10.53% (±0.1% acceptable)
2. ✅ Exactly 6 trades
3. ✅ Trade log shows `prev_baseline_date: 2025-09-23`
4. ✅ Baseline value is 6481.94

## 💡 Key Insights

### Technical:
1. **Trading calendar is essential** - Provides prev_open_date for correct baseline lookup
2. **Conservative pricing works** - Round up buys, round down sells
3. **Position carryover is correct** - Positions carry overnight as expected
4. **Database structure is solid** - All tables and indexes in place

### Business:
