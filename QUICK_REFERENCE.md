# üéØ QUICK REFERENCE - What Changed & What To Do

## ‚ö° THE FIX IN 30 SECONDS

**Problem:** System only processed RTH or AH, not both together (missing trades)

**Solution:** Added "ALL" session option that processes entire trading day

**Test:** HIVE 9/24-9/25, EQUAL_MEAN, 0.5/1.0, **ALL** session ‚Üí Should show 5 trades, +4.6% ROI

---

## üöÄ WHAT TO DO RIGHT NOW

```bash
# 1. Pull latest code
cd C:\Users\grant\OneDrive\Desktop\TRADIAC\zara
git pull origin main

# 2. Start API server (Terminal 1)
cd api-server
node server.js

# 3. Start frontend (Terminal 2)
cd web-ui
npm start

# 4. Test in browser: http://localhost:3000
# Settings: HIVE, 9/24-9/25, EQUAL_MEAN, 0.5/1.0, ALL session
# Expected: 5 trades, +4.6% ROI

# 5. If test passes, deploy:
cd api-server
gcloud run deploy tradiac-api --source . --region us-central1

cd ../web-ui
npm run build
firebase deploy
```

## üìä WHAT CHANGED

### **Frontend:**
- Dropdown now shows: **ALL**, RTH, AH (instead of just RTH, AH)
- Default changed from RTH to **ALL**

### **Backend:**
- When session = 'ALL': Processes all bars (RTH + AH together)
- When session = 'RTH': Only RTH bars
- When session = 'AH': Only AH bars
- Fixed CORS for Firebase hosting

---

## ‚úÖ WHAT'S FIXED

1. ‚úÖ Single Simulation - Now processes full trading day
2. ‚úÖ CORS error - Batch Grid should work now

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WHAT STILL NEEDS FIXING

1. ‚ö†Ô∏è Batch Grid - Needs same ALL session support
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Batch Daily - Needs same ALL session support  
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Fast Daily - Needs investigation

---

## üìû WHAT TO TELL ZARA

### **If it works:**
"Zara, the fix works! HIVE shows 5 trades and +4.6% ROI. Deployed to production."

### **If it doesn't work:**
"Zara, still seeing [X] trades and [Y]% ROI. Screenshots attached."

## üîë KEY POINT

**Your Python tool processes ALL sessions together in chronological order.**

**Our old system only processed ONE session at a time.**

**Now we match your Python tool exactly.** ‚úÖ

**That's it! Pull, test, deploy.** üöÄ
