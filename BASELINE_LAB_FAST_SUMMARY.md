## 📊 What Was Built

### Core Functionality
A comprehensive per-day strategy analysis tool that:
- Tests all method × threshold combinations for each trading day
- Identifies the best performing strategy per day
- Tracks method consistency across all days
- Provides detailed performance metrics and export capabilities

### Key Features Implemented
✅ Multi-symbol selection (11 symbols available)
✅ Date range selection for historical analysis
✅ All 5 baseline methods supported (VWAP_RATIO, VOL_WEIGHTED, WINSORIZED, WEIGHTED_MEDIAN, EQUAL_MEAN)
✅ Session type selection (RTH, AH, ALL)
✅ Configurable threshold ranges (buy/sell with start/end/step)
✅ Sortable results tables (click any column header)
✅ CSV export for both daily winners and method consistency
✅ Real-time processing with loading indicators
✅ Responsive design matching existing reports

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### Backend Endpoint
**File**: `api-server/baseline-lab-fast-endpoint.js` (~350 lines)
**Route**: `POST /api/baseline-lab-fast`
**Status**: ✅ Code complete, committed to GitHub

**Algorithm**:
1. For each symbol and trading day:
   - Fetch minute-by-minute stock and BTC prices
   - Calculate BTC/Stock ratios
   - Get baseline from `baseline_daily` table (previous trading day)
2. Test all method × buy% × sell% combinations
3. Simulate trading and calculate returns
4. Select winner (highest return) for each day
5. Calculate method consistency metrics

**Data Sources**:
- `minute_stock` - Stock minute bars
- `minute_btc` - BTC minute bars  
- `baseline_daily` - Pre-calculated baselines

### Frontend Page
**File**: `frontend-dashboard/app/reports/baseline-lab-fast/page.tsx` (~600 lines)
**Route**: `/reports/baseline-lab-fast`
**Status**: ✅ Deployed to Vercel

**UI Components**:
- Symbol multi-select with Select All/Clear All
- Date range inputs
- Method multi-select with Select All/Clear All
- Session type dropdown
- Threshold range controls (6 inputs total)
- Initial capital input
- Daily Winners table (8 columns, sortable)
- Method Consistency table (6 columns, sortable)
- CSV export buttons

### Home Page Integration
**File**: `frontend-dashboard/app/page.tsx`
**Status**: ✅ Report card added with purple theme and lightning icon

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

Once backend is deployed:

1. **Access the report**:
   ```
   https://frontend-dashboard-e2lkauv2j-logans-projects-57bfdedc.vercel.app/reports/baseline-lab-fast
   ```

2. **Test with these parameters**:
   - Symbols: RIOT, MARA, HIVE
   - Date Range: 2024-10-01 to 2024-10-29
   - Methods: VWAP_RATIO, WINSORIZED, VOL_WEIGHTED
   - Session: RTH
   - Buy%: 0.5 to 2.0, step 0.5
   - Sell%: 1.0 to 4.0, step 0.5
   - Initial Capital: $10,000

3. **Expected results**:
   - ~60 daily winners (3 symbols × 20 days)
   - ~15 consistency metrics (3 symbols × 5 methods)
   - Processing time: 30-90 seconds

4. **Verify functionality**:
   - ✅ Tables populate with data
   - ✅ Sorting works on all columns
   - ✅ CSV export downloads files
   - ✅ No console errors
