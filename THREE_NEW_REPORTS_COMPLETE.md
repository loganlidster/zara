### 2. Baseline Check Report ‚úÖ
**Purpose**: Quick baseline calculation verification for specific dates

**Features**:
- Single-date baseline lookup
- All 5 baseline methods compared
- N-day average support (1-10 days)
- Sample count and statistics
- Visual comparison chart
- Shows which previous dates were used

**Use Case**: Verify baseline calculations are correct, debug issues, understand baseline values

**Location**: `/reports/baseline-check`

### 3. Coverage Report ‚úÖ
**Purpose**: Data quality and coverage analysis

**Features**:
- Multi-symbol coverage analysis
- Shows days with data vs total trading days
- Coverage percentage per symbol
- Missing dates tracking
- Visual coverage bars
- BTC minute count
- Summary statistics
- Export to CSV

**Use Case**: Monitor data quality, identify missing data, ensure complete coverage

**Location**: `/reports/coverage`

## Testing Checklist

Once backend is deployed, test:

### Grid Search Report
- [ ] Select symbol and multiple methods
- [ ] Set buy% range (e.g., 0.5 to 2.0, step 0.5)
- [ ] Set sell% range (e.g., 0.5 to 2.0, step 0.5)
- [ ] Run grid search
- [ ] Verify heatmap displays correctly
- [ ] Check best per method table
- [ ] Switch to table view
- [ ] Export CSV

### Baseline Check Report
- [ ] Select symbol and date
- [ ] Set N-days to 1
- [ ] Check baseline
- [ ] Verify all 5 methods show values
- [ ] Try N-days = 3
- [ ] Verify averaging works
- [ ] Check comparison chart

### Coverage Report
- [ ] Select 3-4 symbols
- [ ] Set date range
- [ ] Analyze coverage
- [ ] Verify coverage percentages
- [ ] Check missing dates
- [ ] Verify BTC minute count
- [ ] Export CSV
