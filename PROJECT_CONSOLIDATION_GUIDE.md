# Project Architecture Guide

## Current Situation

You have **two Google Cloud projects** working together:

1. **`tradiac-testing`** (Project ID: `tradiac-testing`)
2. **`tradiac-testing-66f6e`** (Project ID: `tradiac-testing-66f6e`)

## Your Multi-Project Architecture ✅

This is a **valid and working setup**:

### `tradiac-testing` Project (Backend)
- ✅ **Cloud SQL Database** - PostgreSQL instance at `34.41.97.179`
- ✅ **Cloud Run API** - `tradiac-api` service with your buy/sell logic fix
- ✅ **Cloud Build** - Automatic deployment on GitHub push

### `tradiac-testing-66f6e` Project (Frontend)
- ✅ **Firebase Hosting** - Web UI (configured in `.firebaserc`)

## Current Configuration

- Cloud Build deploys API to: `tradiac-testing`
- Firebase hosts frontend in: `tradiac-testing-66f6e`
- API connects to database in: `tradiac-testing` (same project)

## Verify Your Setup

### 1. Check Cloud Build Trigger

Your Cloud Build trigger should be in the **`tradiac-testing`** project:
- Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/triggers?project=tradiac-testing
- Verify trigger is connected to your GitHub repo

### 2. Check API Deployment

Your API service is in the **`tradiac-testing`** project:
- Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/run?project=tradiac-testing
- Find `tradiac-api` service
- **This is where your buy/sell logic fix is deployed!**

### 3. Check Database

Your Cloud SQL database is in the **`tradiac-testing`** project:
- Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances?project=tradiac-testing
- Database IP: `34.41.97.179`

### 4. Check Frontend

Your Firebase hosting is in the **`tradiac-testing-66f6e`** project:
- Configured in `.firebaserc`
- Deploy manually with: `firebase deploy --only hosting`

## Quick Access Links

### Backend (tradiac-testing)
- **Cloud Build History**: https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds?project=tradiac-testing
- **Cloud Run API**: https://console.cloud.google.com/run?project=tradiac-testing
- **Cloud SQL Database**: https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances?project=tradiac-testing

### Frontend (tradiac-testing-66f6e)
- **Firebase Console**: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/tradiac-testing-66f6e

## What's Already Fixed ✅

✅ Your buy/sell logic fix is deployed to Cloud Run in `tradiac-testing`
✅ Cloud Build now explicitly targets `tradiac-testing` for API deployment
✅ Database connection is working (same project)
✅ Firebase is configured for `tradiac-testing-66f6e`

## Architecture Benefits

This multi-project setup provides:
- **Separation of concerns**: Backend and frontend in different projects
- **Security**: Database and API in same project for better security
- **Flexibility**: Can manage permissions independently

Your setup is working correctly - no consolidation needed!
