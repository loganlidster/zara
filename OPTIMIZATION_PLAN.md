# Make Tradiac CRAZY FAST - Optimization Plan

## Current System Analysis

Your current fast-daily endpoint works but can be slow. Let's identify bottlenecks and fix them.

## Optimization Strategy

### 1. Database Indexes (Biggest Impact)
Add covering indexes for the most common queries:
- minute_stock + minute_btc joins
- baseline_daily lookups
- Date range queries

### 2. Query Optimization
- Reduce number of database round trips
- Use prepared statements
- Batch operations where possible

### 3. Caching
- Cache baseline calculations (they don't change)
- Cache trading calendar lookups
- Use Redis or in-memory cache

### 4. Parallel Processing for Batch
- When user runs batch grid search
- Process multiple combinations in parallel
- Return results as they complete

### 5. Connection Pooling
- Increase pool size
- Reuse connections efficiently
- Handle timeouts gracefully

## Let's Start with Indexes

This will give us the biggest speed boost immediately.
