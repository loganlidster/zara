# Waiting for Baseline Recalculation to Complete

## Current Status
- Script is running
- Processing March 2024
- ~110 baselines per day
- Estimated 15-20 minutes total

## What Happens Next
1. Script completes full date range (2024-01-01 to 2025-10-26)
2. Shows comparison with Grant's CSV
3. Verifies accuracy of calculations
4. Pauses for Grant to review results

## After Completion
Grant will report back with:
- Did it complete successfully?
- Do the baselines match the CSV?
- Any errors or issues?

Then we proceed to Step 2: Create dual pre-computed tables.
