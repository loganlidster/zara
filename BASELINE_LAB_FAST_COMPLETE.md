# Baseline Lab ‚Äî FAST Report - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

## Overview

The **Baseline Lab ‚Äî FAST Report** is now fully implemented and deployed. This is the **BUSINESS CRITICAL** report that finds the best performing method and thresholds for EACH trading day, providing insights into which strategies work best on specific days.

## What This Report Does

### Core Functionality
1. **Per-Day Winner Selection**: Tests all method √ó threshold combinations for each trading day and identifies the best performer
2. **Method Consistency Tracking**: Shows which methods win most often across all days
3. **Multi-Symbol Analysis**: Processes multiple symbols simultaneously
4. **Comprehensive Metrics**: Provides win rates, average returns, and detailed performance data

### Key Features
- **Multi-symbol selection** with Select All/Clear All buttons
- **Date range selection** for historical analysis
- **Method selection** (all 5 baseline methods supported)
- **Session type selection** (RTH, AH, or ALL)
- **Threshold ranges** with configurable start/end/step values
- **Sortable results tables** with click-to-sort columns
- **CSV export** for both daily winners and method consistency
- **Real-time processing** with loading indicators

      "win_rate_pct": "75.00",
      "avg_return_pct": "3.45"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Frontend Page
**File**: `frontend-dashboard/app/reports/baseline-lab-fast/page.tsx`
**Route**: `/reports/baseline-lab-fast`

**Components**:
- Symbol multi-select with toggle buttons
- Date range inputs
- Method multi-select with toggle buttons
- Session type dropdown
- Threshold range controls (buy/sell with start/end/step)
- Initial capital input
- Daily Winners table (sortable)
- Method Consistency table (sortable)
- CSV export buttons

### Algorithm Logic

For each trading day:
1. Fetch minute-by-minute stock and BTC prices
2. Calculate BTC/Stock ratios
3. For each method:
   - Get baseline from `baseline_daily` table
   - For each buy% √ó sell% combination:
     - Simulate trading with those thresholds
     - Track trades and calculate final equity
4. Select the combination with highest return as the winner
5. Track which method won for consistency metrics

### Database Tables Used
- `minute_stock` - Stock minute bars
- `minute_btc` - BTC minute bars
- `baseline_daily` - Pre-calculated baselines (uses previous trading day)

## Deployment Status

### ‚úÖ Frontend Deployed
- **URL**: https://frontend-dashboard-e2lkauv2j-logans-projects-57bfdedc.vercel.app/reports/baseline-lab-fast
- **Status**: Live and accessible
- **Deployment**: Automated via Vercel

### ‚è≥ Backend Pending
- **Code**: Committed to GitHub (commit a6b6509)
- **File**: `api-server/baseline-lab-fast-endpoint.js`
- **Route**: Added to `server.js`
- **Action Required**: User needs to trigger Cloud Build to deploy

## How to Deploy Backend

### Option 1: Google Cloud Console (Recommended)
1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds?project=tradiac-testing
2. Click "Run" or "Trigger Build"
3. Select the repository: `github_loganlidster_zara`
4. Select branch: `main`
5. Wait for build to complete (~3-5 minutes)
6. Backend will be automatically deployed to Cloud Run

### Option 2: Command Line (If gcloud is set up)
```bash
gcloud builds submit --config=api-server/cloudbuild.yaml
```

## Testing Instructions

Once backend is deployed:

1. **Navigate to the report**:
   - Go to https://frontend-dashboard-e2lkauv2j-logans-projects-57bfdedc.vercel.app
   - Click on "Baseline Lab ‚Äî FAST" card

2. **Configure parameters**:
   - Select symbols (e.g., RIOT, MARA, HIVE)
   - Set date range (e.g., 2024-10-01 to 2024-10-29)
   - Select methods (e.g., VWAP_RATIO, WINSORIZED, VOL_WEIGHTED)
   - Choose session type (RTH recommended for testing)
   - Set threshold ranges (defaults are good for testing)

3. **Run analysis**:
   - Click "Find Best Strategies Per Day"
   - Wait for processing (may take 30-60 seconds for multiple symbols)

4. **Review results**:
   - **Daily Winners table**: Shows best method/thresholds for each day
   - **Method Consistency table**: Shows which methods win most often
   - Sort by clicking column headers
   - Export to CSV for further analysis

## Expected Results

For a typical 20-day period with 3 symbols:
- **Daily Winners**: ~60 rows (3 symbols √ó 20 days)
- **Method Consistency**: ~15 rows (3 symbols √ó 5 methods)
- **Processing Time**: 30-90 seconds depending on threshold combinations

## Business Value

This report answers critical questions:
1. **Which method works best on specific days?**
2. **Which methods are most consistent winners?**
3. **What threshold combinations perform best per day?**
4. **How do different symbols respond to different strategies?**
